# E-commerce-Analytics
Objective is to study the online retail dataset from different perspectives by utilizing data mining techniques for customer centric business. Our aim is to understand the customer behaviour, product associations, web traffic, inventory management and returned products. My analysis can help any new or old e-commerce company such as Amazon, Wish Shopping Sites etc. to design their new marketing campaign, strategies to retain their customers and ways to attract new users or one-time visitors. The recommendations I have come up with are exclusive and unique and could be helpful for the e-commerce sector.
